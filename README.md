<h2 style="text-align:center;">Surf's Up: Advanced SQL Data Storage and Retrieval Homework</h2>
<p>There are four main objectives to this homework:</p>
<h4>Data Engineering</h4>
<p>Raw data will be cleaned and beaten into submission using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. The .csv files will be inspected for NaNs, missing values, duplicates, and other such gaps.</p>
<h4>Database Engineering</h4>
<p>SQL Alchemy is utilized to model table schemas and create a sqlite database for the cleaned data. Jupyter Notebook will again be used for this engineering.</p>
<h4>Climate Analysis and Exploration</h4>
<p>After being readied for exploration and analysis, several analyses will be performed using a combination of SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analyses include:
<ul>
      <li>Precipitation Analysis</li>
      <li>Station Analysis</li>
      <li>Temperature Analysis</li>
</ul></p>
<h4>Climate App</h4>
<p>Using the queries developed in the above activity, a Flask API has been designed to return user queries in a json format. Temperature (min, max, and average) and date observations as well as stations are included in the routes.</p>
